* Need to monitor what files are being read by gulp
* Eventually want a watch task that could run only the tasks that were required to rebuild files that are modified
* Need to store the output so that it can be re-used for watching
* Need to add some reporting on the output with some sort of quriing (e.g. what tasks use file1, what files go into file2)
